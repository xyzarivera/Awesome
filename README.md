# Awesome

This is `Xyza's Developer Cheat Sheet`. Inspired by the [Proudcloud Awesome](https://github.com/proudcloud/awesome) repository where they document their best practices, basically what makes them `awesome`. This is where she will document her notes while learning different fields in tech. 

She had troubled keeping notes in different note-taking applications and probably on how she can share these learnings also. So, she decided to create this repository, open for everyone to check.

> This repository is always a work in progress.
