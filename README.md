# Awesome

This is `Xyza's Cheat Sheet`. Inspired by the [Proudcloud Awesome](https://github.com/proudcloud/awesome) repository where they document their best practices.
This is where she will document her learnings from different fields. 

She had troubled keeping notes in different applications and probably on how she can share them also. So, she decided to create this repository, open for everyone to check.
