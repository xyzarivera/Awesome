## Topics

### Convolutional Neural Networks

[Very Deep Convolutional Networks For Large Scale Image Recognition]

### VGG

It's all about deep neural network architecture. This is one of the classic image classification architecture wherein many of our recent algorithm uses it as a backbone. 

[Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting]
Dropout. It's all about the concept of regularization. On how we can use it to make our ML algorithm be more robust on generalizing on our test set.

MNIST+LeNet in pytorch from scratch (we would then discuss how it is analogous to VGG with imagenet example)

### ADAM

[ADAM: A Method for Stochastic Optimization.pdf]
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf

For this one, it's all about understanding the behaviours on how we optimize the weights of the network. We would understand the direction of the research on this field of optimization.
