UX tip: Write up a quick case study when you finish a project of any size. You'll improve your storytelling and get a huge list of case studies.

Quickly jot down:

• The challenge we faced
• What we didn’t understand
• Attempts to solve
• Critical learnings
• Screenshots

A good portfolio is not just a collection of things you made. It is a collection of how you think.
